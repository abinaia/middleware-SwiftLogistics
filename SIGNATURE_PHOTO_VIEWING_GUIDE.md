## 🗄️ **Database Storage**

**Deliveries Table Structure**:
```sql
deliveries (
  id,
  delivery_id,
  customer_name,
  delivery_address,
  status,
  signature_url,    -- ✅ Stores signature data
  photo_url,        -- ✅ NEW: Stores photo data  
  completed_at,     -- ✅ Completion timestamp
  delivery_notes,
  ...
)
```

**Data Access**:
- Signature: `delivery.signatureUrl`
- Photo: `delivery.photoUrl`
- Completion Time: `delivery.completedAt`
- Status: `delivery.status = 'COMPLETED'`

## 🚀 **Next Steps & Enhancements**

### **Immediate Actions**:
1. ✅ **Test the App**: Switch to "Completed" tab and test the view buttons
2. ✅ **Complete a Delivery**: Use signature + photo capture to create test data
3. ✅ **Verify Storage**: Check that proof appears in completed deliveries

### **Future Enhancements**:
